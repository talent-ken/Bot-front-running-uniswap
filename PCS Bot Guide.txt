PANCAKESWAP FrontRunner BOT
(JavaScript Implementation)

• Step 1.
Download and install Node.JS (LTS version recommended)
Linux:
sudo apt install nodejs
Mac:
brew install nodejs
Windows:
Download from Node.JS website
• Step 2.
Edit the .env settings


REACT_APP_RPC_URL & REACT_APP_RPC_URL_WSS
→ HTTP-URL and WSS providers. Use any Binance node service. Simply sign up for one of these services and enter provided URLS.
REACT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY
→ This is the private wallet key from MetaMask. I recommend creating a new wallet for this program.
REACT_APP_ACCOUNT
→ Your wallets public address (Make sure you Hold the PCS BOT Coin in this Wallet Address)
REACT_APP_TOKEN_ADDRESS
→ The address of your targeted token, make sure this is checksummed (contains uppercase characters). The address in the photo is for the token API3.
REACT_APP_EXCHANGE_ADDRESS
→ The PANCAKESWAP ROUTER V2 address. Do not change this.
REACT_APP_BNB_AMOUNT & REACT_APP_TARGET_BNB_AMOUNT
→ Pretty self explanatory. BNB_AMOUNT is the amount you are going to purchase, TARGET_BNB is the sale you are waiting for.
REACT_APP_SLIPPAGE & REACT_APP_GAS_MULTIPLIER
→ Slippage is the same as it would be on PANCAKESWAP. Make sure this is set corresponding to PANCAKESWAP.
→ Gas Multiplier is how much you are going to speed up the transaction you are frontrunning. A good multiplier is typically between 1.3-2. The higher the multiplier, the more you will pay in gas fees.
• Step 3.
Navigate to the folder within terminal (cd & ls) and type node index.js to begin the program. You can quit anytime by pressing CTRL + C.

IMPORTANT
The .env may be missing from your folder view. I assure you it is there. Look up commands to show hidden files or if you use Sublime Text, simply subl . the directory and it will appear. APPROVE SWAP on PANCAKESWAP prior to using the frontrunner on a token, or else the bot will be able to buy but not sell.

THANK YOU & ENJOY :)
